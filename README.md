## Introduction

A sudoku handling SDK using brute forces and logical techniques. Now this solution supports generating puzzles, solving puzzles (with logical & illogical techniques) and some attribute checking (for example, to determine whether the specified grid is a minimal puzzle, which will become multiple solutions when any a digit is missing).

### Sample

Here I give you [a sample](https://sunnieshine.github.io/Sudoku/usages/en/solve-by-manual) to demonstrate how to solve a puzzle using manual sudoku techniques.

### Extra description

In the future, I'd like to apply this solution to **almost every platform**. I may finish the Win10 app project, android app project, bot on common on-line platforms (QQ, Bilibili and so on).

Please note that the programming language version is always used as 'preview', which means some preview features are still used in this solution.

You can also use JetBrains Rider as your IDE. Use whatever you want to use, even Notepad :D Although C# contains some syntaxes that are only allowed in Visual Studio (e.g. keyword `__makeref`), this repo doesn't use them. Therefore, you can use other IDEs to develop the code in this repo liberally.

In addition, the framework and IDE version may update in the future; in other words, they aren't changeless. The information is **for reference only**.

### Repository Positioning

This repository is created for the following kinds of users:

* **who likes sudoku algorithms**: If you like to study for sudoku techniques and its backing implementation and running mechanism, you can find answer in this repository.
* **who wants to learn about C#-related features**: This repository uses some C# newer features and .NET-related features such as Windows UI, which can help you learn more about it as practicing.
* **myself**: The codes are very important for me to learn sudoku and algorithms.
